## üîÑ Identified Improvements (Future Enhancement Opportunities)

## 1. Unified Image Handling
- **Description:** Implement a single, comprehensive `OptimizedImage` UI component (or enhance an existing one like `ParallaxImage` to be more generic) that centralizes responsive image loading, lazy loading, and consistent application of `border-radius`, `object-fit`, and `box-shadow` from the theme.
- **Reasoning:** Currently, images are handled in various ways (direct `img` tags, `background-image` in styled components, `ParallaxImage`). A unified component would ensure visual consistency, improve performance, and simplify image management across the site.

## 2. Button Component Consolidation/Guidance
- **Description:** Evaluate the usage of `Button.tsx` and `AnimatedButton.tsx`. If `AnimatedButton` is intended to be the primary button component due to its richer features and animations, consider deprecating `Button.tsx` or clearly defining its specific use cases (e.g., for very simple, non-animated buttons).
- **Reasoning:** Having two similar button components can lead to inconsistency in design and behavior if not used with clear guidelines.

## 3. Tabs Component Consolidation/Guidance
- **Description:** Similar to buttons, evaluate `Tabs.tsx` and `TabsContainer.tsx`. `Tabs.tsx` appears more feature-rich and comprehensive. Consolidate them into a single, robust `Tabs` component or provide clear guidelines on when to use each.
- **Reasoning:** Redundant components can lead to confusion and inconsistent UI patterns.

## 4. Consistent Use of Theming Variables
- **Description:** Conduct a thorough review to ensure all colors, spacing, border-radii, and shadows are consistently pulled from the global `theme` object rather than being hardcoded `px` or hex values directly within `styled-components`.
- **Reasoning:** Full adherence to the theming system ensures easy global style changes and maintains visual cohesiveness across the entire website.

## 5. Enhanced Visual Consistency for Section Headers
- **Description:** Standardize the appearance of `SectionHeader` elements across all pages and components. While many pages have similar headers, subtle variations in font size, weight, and margin might exist. Consider creating a dedicated `SectionHeader` component (if not already implicitly handled by `Typography` and `Container` combinations) to enforce this consistency.
- **Reasoning:** Consistent section headers provide a strong visual rhythm and improve the overall professional look of the website.

## 6. Refined Project Card Imagery (ProjectsSection)
- **Description:** For the `ProjectsSection`, consider if the current approach of using colored backgrounds with text/emoji icons for project images aligns with the overall visual language, especially if other sections use realistic images. If not, explore integrating actual project images (perhaps using the proposed `OptimizedImage` component) or refining the current abstract style to be more visually cohesive with the rest of the site.
- **Reasoning:** This is a specific visual inconsistency that stands out and could be unified for a more cohesive portfolio presentation.

## 7. "Coming Soon" Page Enhancement
- **Description:** For pages like `News.tsx` that are currently "Coming Soon," enhance the placeholder content. This could include a simple animation, a newsletter signup form (if not already prominently featured elsewhere), or a brief message about when content is expected.
- **Reasoning:** A static "Coming Soon" message can feel unengaging. Enhancing it provides a better user experience and maintains interest.

## 8. Interactive Element States (Hover/Focus/Active)
- **Description:** Review all interactive elements (buttons, links, cards, form inputs) to ensure their hover, focus, and active states are visually consistent and provide clear, intuitive feedback to the user. Leverage `framer-motion` and theme variables for these states.
- **Reasoning:** Consistent interactive states improve usability, accessibility, and the overall polish of the user interface.
